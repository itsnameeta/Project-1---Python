# Project-1---Python
Project 1 - Group 2
Topic:
To what extent has the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic impacted these areas in the last couple of years in Australia:
The Economy, Unemployment rate, and Health.

Instructions:
1. Python Code is in the main folder and are in independent Jupiter notebooks (for sub-topics - health, unemployment and business) 
2. Data and resources are in the Data folder split across sub-topics.
3. Graphs/ charts/ images are in the Analysis folder split across sub-topics.
4. API's are not used since we found most of the data required in excels/ CSV format. 

Hypothesis:
We expected to see an overall change and possible impacts in the following due to the pandemic. 
1. Health: Increased reported cases of suicides, Increased use of crisis hotlines and Increase in deaths
2. Unemployment:  Covid-19 and lockdowns had a marginal impact on Australian unemployment rate. 
3. Business/ Economy:  Declined GDP and supply chain measures, Negative impact to Australian dollar trade-weighted Index  and Decrease in Industry Gross Operating Profits 

Scope:
1. Extracting COVID-19 Infections/ cases, Business, Unemployment, Health and International trade related data available for Australia – Primary data resources are:
Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), World Health organisation (WHO), Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, NSW Ministry of Health and Coroner’s Court of Victoria

2. Preparing and Cleaning the data: Raw data retrieved from sources mentioned earlier were clean and well categorized. Minimal cosmetic adjustments were made before detailed analysis including:
  a. Merging Covid-19 monthly infection cases with key measures for correlation analysis
  b. Trimming and formatting the data frames to remove report headers and comments
  c. Formatting the data frames into usable time series (Yearly, Quarterly, Monthly, Weekly)
  d. Created columns to provide year and timepoint information

3. Analysing data for impacts of COVID-19 in key areas identified.

4. Visualising our analysis and summarizing the findings: Plotting charts/ graphs (Bar, Pie, Line, Scatter, Boxplot, Line Regression, Correlation tests) using Matplotlib libraries

Conclusion:
1. Health: 
      More deaths due to an overload of the health system - more deaths from other causes were the result i.e. pneumonia.
      Less deaths from the common flu = only 36 in 2020 and 0 in 2021 (amazing) vs 902 in 2019 - due to lockdown and use of masks?
      Less mental health issues/stress levels resulting from isolation and working from home –positive benefits
2. Unemployment:  
      Currently seeing a spike in Covid-19 cases again (Vic, NSW). Will need to complete correlation test again later this year to study the impact of Covid-19 from July-December 2021. Further analysis needs to be conducted to see if political and economic policies introduced in the last two years correlated with the rise/fall of the unemployment rate. 	
3. Business/ Economy:  
      Covid-19 had a significant impact in the initial quarter (June’20) on Australian business and economy. 
      Impact of further restrictions and rise in covid-19 cases during September’21 quarter on business indicators
